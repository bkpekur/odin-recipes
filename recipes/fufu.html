    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Fufu is prepared by pounding boiled cassava(some prefer to add boiled plantain as well)
        into soft and thick paste. This paste is then slowly turned and moulded into
        the desired sizes which is enjoyed with light-soup, groundnut soup or "ebunubunu"-local
        parlance for green soup prepared using snails.
